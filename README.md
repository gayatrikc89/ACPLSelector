Description of ACPLSelector Web Application
The application allows users to analyze and compare attribute-based access control policy languages. The web application provides the following features:-

Letâ€™s get ACPL recommendations:

This form, as shown in figure 1, allows user to specify her usage needs and requirements concerning attribute based access control policy languages.  The user can select check-boxes and items from drop-down lists while considering and specifying all the features and characteristics that the user requires in attribute based access control policy languages, out of those presented to the user. The specified criteria are matched with the backend table at the server and the user is presented with a list of attribute based access control policy languages along with their recommendation scores, as shown in figure 2. The recommendation scores directly indicate the number of criteria of the attribute based access control policy language which match with the one specified by the user in the form before. So, the attribute based access control policy language which will have more number of matching features with the ones specified by user, will have higher recommendation score than others. We trust that our recommendations will ease the task of user in selecting the attribute based access control policy language most suited to her usage needs and requirements.
